# New-year-count-down
A dynamic countdown timer built with JavaScript that counts down to New Yearâ€™s Day. This project calculates the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds to January 1st and displays it in real-time. When New Year arrives, the countdown resets to start counting down to the next New Year.
